<br>Promise Yourself</br>
<br>To be so strong that nothing<br>can disturb your peace of mind.<br>To talk health, happiness, and prosperity<br>to every person you meet.</br>
<!-- <br>To make all your friends feel<br>that there is something in them<br>To look at the sunny side of everything<br>and make your optimism come true.</br>
<br>To think only the best, to work only for the best, <br>and to expect only the best.<br>To be just as enthusiastic about the success of others<br>as you are about your own.</br>
<br>To forget the mistakes of the past<br>and press on to the greater achievements of the future.<br>To wear a cheerful countenance at all times<br>and give every living creature you meet a smile.</br>
<br>To give so much time to the improvement of yourself<br>that you have no time to criticize others.<br>To be too large for worry, too noble for anger, too<br>strong for fear,<br>and too happy to permit the presence of trouble.</br>
<br>To think well of yourself and to proclaim this fact <br>to the world,
<br>not in loud words but great deeds.
<br>To live in faith that the whole world is on your side
<br>so long as you are true to the best that is in you.”</br>

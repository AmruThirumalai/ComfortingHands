        <p>Girls Who Code is a non-profit, international organization who's goal is to support and increase the number of women 
            and girls in computer science</p>
        <p>This website is a project created by the Girls Who Code branch at Eastern High School;
             We are upstart coders who worked to create an app dedicated to mental health last year.
              This year, our goal was to increase the accessibility of our original project by building a website of the same name. </p>
